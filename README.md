My Data Science portfolio website.

Because I am not a web developer and do not have natural web design talents, I took inspirations from a few places : 
- Kevin Powell [course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/portfolio)

Logo from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/fr/)

# TODO

- Adapt fonts
- adapt colors
- change images
- find cool stuff on templates HTML, CSS, JS to make my own site really

Wanted theme :

- Clear theme, white background, probably marine blue as color somewhere ?
