        <p>Bank chargebacks pose a significant threat, accompanied by the specter of 
        escalating fees and exponential growth. Understanding and mitigating this 
        risk has been a pivotal aspect of our fraud detection initiative.

        Detail challenges that lead to ML solutions below : SLA with low latency, labels
