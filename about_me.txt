I'm a MLE (Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Scientist with coding skills) with a strong mathematical background, a problem-solving mindset and a passion for Football.

My path to Data Science began when I realized the vast potential of applying mathematical concepts to real-world challenges. I particularly improved my skills at Ubisoft, where I spent three years deploying Machine Learning models to detect in-game fraudulent transactions, a role that allowed me to manage end-to-end Machine Learning projects.

I am excited to start my next adventure as a MLE at GitGuardian, a leading company in the Cybersecurity domain, where I will be leveraging ML capabilities to analyze source code and help companies secure their infrastructure.

In the meantime, I am developing personal projects related to Football. You can also find me playing Football every week, going to the Gym, reading books or hanging out with friends in Paris or elsewhere. If you want to have a talk about some projects or about Football Analytics in general, please contact me at <a href="mailto:michael.romagne@gmail.com" class="about_me__social-list__link">michael.romagne@gmail.com</a>.
