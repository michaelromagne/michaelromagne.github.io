I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong mathematical background. My path to Data Science began when I realized the vast potential of applying mathematical concepts to real-world challenges.

I particularly improved my skills at Ubisoft, where I spent three years deploying Machine Learning models to detect in-game fraudulent transactions. This experience taught me how to manage end-to-end Machine Learning projects.

Then, I joined GitGuardian as a Machine Learning Engineer, where we help companies secure their infrastructure thanks to secrets detection in source code, Infrastructure as Code vulnerabilities detection and Software Component Analysis.
I am working on fine-tuning Large Language Models to detect secrets and deploy them in our AWS infrastructure. I also did PoCs to automatically replace hardcoded secrets in code with environment variables (OpenAI API vs AST then code formatting like Black).

In the meantime, I am developing personal projects. You can also find me playing Football every week, going to the Gym, reading books or hanging out with friends in Paris or elsewhere.
