I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong mathematical background. My path to Data Science began when I realized the vast potential of applying mathematical concepts to business challenges.

First, I improved my skills at Ubisoft, where I spent three years deploying Machine Learning models to detect in-game fraudulent transactions. This experience taught me how to manage end-to-end Machine Learning projects.

Then, I joined GitGuardian as a Machine Learning Engineer to work on fine-tuning Large Language Models to detect secrets and deploy them in our AWS infrastructure. I also developed a feature to automatically replace leaked secrets in code with environment variables.

After these two experiences, I wanted to try the freelance experience to continue to grow in ownership and skills. I join Sanofi for a year, developing a scalable Unstructured Data Parsing pipeline to make this knowledge available for whole Sanofi in a Vector DB. It included benchmarking of Vision-Language Models vs OCR libraries, benchmark of LLMs for metadata generation, research on chunking and retrieval approaches, infrastructure as code and DevOps on AWS. The pipeline is now used to parse millions of PDFs and other types of files at Sanofi.
