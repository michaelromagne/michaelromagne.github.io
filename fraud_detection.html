            <p>
                For the last 3 years, I have immersed myself in the Gaming World at Ubisoft,
                working on a Fraud Detection use case. <br>The primary objective of the project is 
                to block e-commerce transactions deemed too risky in real time.

                <br><strong>But what risks are we talking about ?</strong> In this article, I will describe how online
                merchants can lose a lot of money and tarnish its reputation due to e-commerce frauds and how
                we used Machine Learning to mitigate risk at Ubisoft.

            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; font-size:40px;">How Do We Tackle It?</h2>
            <p>
                First, historically the first system used at Ubisoft was a big rule based system.
                On the one hand, rule based systems decisions are easy to explain if a customer complains and
                are rule sets are pretty simple so the fraud check is very quick.

                Our approach involves a robust set of components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Platform hosted on AWS</li>
                <li>Feature store with Spark flows</li>
                <li>Implementation of an ML model (XGBoost)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; font-size:40px;">What Machine Learning brang to Fraud Detection performances ?</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Key Metrics and Impact</h3>
            <p>
                As said in the first part, we aimed at replacing a third party tool, 
                that is a rule based fraud detection system.
                The success of our project is reflected in key metrics such as a notable gain in net sales, 
                the efficiency of our tech stack, and the valuable time saved by fraud experts.
                Also, we noticed several capital human errors made on the rule based system.
            </p>
        
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Control Group and AB Test</h3>
            <p>
                To estimate gains accurately, we implemented a controlled experiment using a Control Group and AB testing methodology. This allowed us to rigorously assess the impact of our fraud detection system and refine our strategies.
            </p>
        
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Model Implementation and Explainability</h3>
            <p>
                Our approach combines the power of XGBoost with explainability tools like explainerdashboards. This ensures that the model not only detects fraud effectively but also provides insights into its decision-making process.
            </p>
        
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">AWS Platform and Tableau Dashboards</h3>
            <p>
                Leveraging the capabilities of the AWS platform, our fraud detection system is hosted on a scalable and secure infrastructure. Tableau dashboards provide intuitive visualizations for monitoring and analysis.
            </p>
        
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Exploration of One-Class Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>
                As part of our continuous improvement, we delved into research on one-class supervised learning and semi-supervised techniques, exploring innovative approaches to enhance our fraud detection capabilities.
