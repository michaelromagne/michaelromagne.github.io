            <p>
                During 3 years, I have immersed myself in the Gaming World at Ubisoft. The company has developed some of the most iconic video games with the Assassin's Creed series, Rainbow Six Siege, Far Cry, Rayman, Just Dance and many others, making it the french biggest video game studio and one of the major ones in the world.
                
                <br>From the start, Ubisoft has placed Innovation and Data at the center of their business. They started to track gaming metrics very early on, making it a rich place for Data practicioners.
                Recommendation systems, chat moderation, in-game cheater detection, in-game trained bots are examples of this diversity.

                <br><br>At Ubisoft, my primary focus was <strong> E-commerce Fraud Detection</strong>. Ubisoft sells lots of games or in-game products (virtual currency, skins, DLCs) on their website, Ubiconnect gaming application and Gaming platforms like Steam.
                Some of these products have a big success and are appealing for fraudsters, who seek buying them for "free" and reselling the products to real gamers with a big discount. This is a win-win transaction for them, but a big loss for the merchant.
                In fact, most Payment Service Providers state that <strong>it is the responsibility of the e-commerce merchant to detect and block Fraud</strong>, and they may be charged if they do not do so. That's where Machine Learning comes into play.

            </p>
        
            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; font-size:40px;">The Risk of Fraud</h2>
            <br>            
            <img src="img/fraud_article/cgb.PNG" width="700px" alt="Chargeback" style="margin-top: 5px; padding-top: 10px;">
            <br>
            <p>First, it is worth diving in the definition of a Fraud. Let's assume a transaction made by a shopper in Ubisoft e-commerce ecosystem. 
                Ubisoft receives funds, the goods are delivered to the customer/player and he can have fun.
                For most transactions, that's it.
                However in rare cases, several weeks or months later, a random cardholder may be surprised
                by a Ubisoft charge on his bank account that he never intentionaly did and dispute it to his bank.
                
                In that case, the bank will initiate a <strong>chargeback</strong>,
                that will be sent to Ubisoft through the card network. If Ubisoft can not show 
                that the chargeback is an abuse from the cardholder, they have to return the funds 
                to the cardholder, with <strong>additional chargeback fees</strong> charged by the <strong>Payment Service Provider</strong> 
                (15euros in case of Paypal, 20 euros in case of Worldpay). On top of that, if an e-merchant is victim of too many frauds,
                the banks will accept less payments for this company, as illustrated by Microsoft in the figure below.
                
                <center><img src="img/fraud_article/acceptance_rate.PNG" width="800px" alt="acceptance" style="margin-top: 5px; padding-top: 10px;"></center>

                <br>
                When Ubisoft is aware of a fraud, they may not even be able to withdraw the product from the fraudster (shopper) account.
                Virtual currency packs for instance are not revocable and represent 80 to 90 % of the in-game transactions, thus are highly targeted by fraud.
                The malicious actors can then sell these products at a very low price and make a good margin.
                
            </p>


            <p>You can imagine how this money can be used, from isolated fraudsters trying to
                make easy money to organized groups willing to finance criminal organisations.
                This is an ethical issue that businesses are willing to tackle. But the most important problem for these companies
                is the <strong>exponential growth of the number of frauds</strong> when a breach is open.
                That is what fraudsters are looking for : easy money with easy breaches. And as in every security domain, the
                best defense for companies is too <strong>create as much friction as possible</strong> on the fraudster path,
                to deter the malicious actor from attacking their business and make them attack other more vulnerable merchants.
                
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; font-size:40px;">How Machine Learning can help</h2>

            <p>The friction concept is interesting for Machine Learning Engineers. It means that <strong>we do not have to develop a perfect model 
            catching every single fraud</strong>. Be sure that if an attacker is motivated enough, he will manage to pass through your model or infrastructure.
            <br>For business stakeholders, this is sometimes hard to accept, as fraud raises strong feelings. Nobody wants to be victim of fraud.
            However, it is key to look at the cost of frauds and put the fear emotions in perspective.
            Indeed, it may turn out that in some segments of your e-commerce business, fraud chargebacks are not that expensive. That is the case for Ubisoft on Steam in-game transactions for instance,
            in which Steam is liable for frauds and do not forward chargebacks to game producers. In this case, you should be much more laxist : <strong>if you try to block more frauds, you will necesarily block more legit customers.</strong>

            <center><img src="img/fraud_article/tp.png" width="400px" alt="tp" style="margin-top: 5px; padding-top: 10px;"></center>

            <br>

            In these situations, you want to perform a <strong>cost analysis</strong> to evaluate your model and have an estimate of the Return On Investment of the project.
            You associate gains and loss to each decision of your model : how much money do you save when you block a fraudster ? How much do you lose when you block a legit customer ?

            <br>In this project, <strong>the baseline is the performances of the product previously used to detect fraud</strong>.
            We know that this tool manages to limit the chargeback rate at a low level but at the cost of a very high False Positive Rate.
            This is due to complex handwritten hard rules, accumulated after years of fraud management by payment and fraud experts.
            The rules are not versioned and the knowledge is almost only held by a single person, making it a perfect use case for ML success.

            <br>
            <br>There are still some challenges to overcome: 

            <ul>
                <li>We analyze all e-commerce transactions in real-time, with strict SLA : 200ms to respond process the payload, compute features and make the prediction.</li>
                <li>Adversarial context : Fraudsters will continuously adapt to beat your model.</li>
                <li>As described in the chargeback flow, the fraud labels come from banks with a big delay, from several weeks to a few months. So our dataset labels are corrupted.</li>
                <li>If we block a transaction in real time, we will never get label, because the payment is not completed.</li>
                <li>We have very few frauds, leading to highly skewed datasets.</li>
            </ul>

            So the Machine Learning problem we are trying to solve has slightly evolved.
            We want to <strong>replace a rule-engine by a machine learning model</strong>, by taking advantage of a lot of transactional data, with the objective of <strong>controlling the chargeback rate and accept as many legit customers as possible.</strong>

        
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px; font-size:40px;">How Do We Tackle It?</h3>

            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">A Feature Store</h3>
                <p>
                Ubisoft has a lot of gaming and transactional data that Machine Learning Engineers can exploit.
                For Fraud Detection, <strong>Feature Engineering is key</strong>. Thus, we spent a lot of time with Ubisoft
                Fraud experts to determine the characteristics of each fraud attacks Ubisoft has undergone in its history.
                Here are some risk factors we spotted and translated in features: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The customer already frauded in the past.</li>
                    <li>A high "velocity" (high number of transactions) in a short amount of time.</li>
                    <li>A high amount with an account created very recently.</li>
                    <li>A player who used to play in the USA but the transaction is done in India.</li>
                    <li>The customer deactivated his 2fa just before an expensive transaction with an unusual transaction country.</li>
                </ul>

                These features have to be computed in real-time, and require several table joins that take time. Thus, in order to
                match the strict SLA, we needed to have an efficient way of getting these values. That's what a <strong>Feature Store</strong>
                can bring. By computing parts of the features in daily batches, we can retrieve feature values much more rapidly.
                For instance, you can add the timestamps of the new transactions that the customers made each day in an individual time series and maintain these arrays
                of all transactions done by customers in tables. During inference, you just have to apply the feature function on those.
                        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Futhermore, The Feature Store is a <strong>more reliable</strong> way of computing features for this kind of application:
                    the definitions are centralized, they are tested and the values are monitored. It ensures an alignment between offline (training)
                    and online (real-time inference) feature values.
                    Below is a simple schema describing the Feature Store. If you want more detail, you can have a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmZIYcHGX9U">great talk</a>
                    by Jeanine Harb, former Data Engineer in the team.

                    </p>


            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">XGBoost for the win</h3>
                
                <br>We have highly unbalanced data and latency in fraud flags making our dataset corrupted. It seems to be a good use-case for experimentation. 
                
                <br>We explored <strong>semi-supervised learning and weakly supervised learning</strong>, with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08623">Deviation Networks</a> for Anomaly Detection for instance.
                We assumed that all non-fraud transactions had no labels, as this is a label by default and all have a chance to be a fraud someday if someone complains to his bank.
                The only sure labels are frauds because we had a chargeback from banks. Deviation networks push anomalies far from the normal data, attracting similar data points. When we use this algorithm, we assume that frauds are anomalies, that some features differ from legit transactions.
                This approach was interesting but unfortunately frauds generally do not vary so much from normal data due to the adversarial behavior of fraudsters who try to mimick normal transactions.
                Nevertheless, it had the interest to analyze past data and dig in legit transactions looking similar to frauds. It can help clean our labels.

                <br>Despite many tests done to improve performances, on tabular data <strong>the secret sauce remains having strong features correlated with fraud and train Gradient Boosted Trees</strong>.
                We added a undersampling step to rebalance our dataset before training The XGBoost model. Another characteristic of this model is the very low latency for inference, which is required.

                <br><strong>Feature Engineering</strong> and <strong>exchange with fraud experts</strong> always was the best lever to get closer to a product that satisfy business stakeholder by catching fraud efficiently and accepting most of legit users.
                It may not be very shiny, but it is pragmatic.

                
                <p>
                    Lastly, we use explainability tools like <strong><a href="https://github.com/oegedijk/explainerdashboard">explainerdashboards</a></strong>.
                    This is very convenient to debug our model, fully understand it and explain the model's decisions to customers which is mandatory if a customer contacts the customer service.
                    On top of that, we added <strong>unit tests on ML model performances on slices of our dataset</strong> to ensure that there is no regression when we deploy a new model.

                    <center><img src="img/fraud_article/explainer_dashboard.jpg" width="800px" alt="exp" style="margin-top: 5px; padding-top: 10px;"></center>
                </p>

                Explainability is key for this project, so after moving from a very complex rule engine (previous product)
                to a Machine Learning model with great feature engineering, we finally started a <strong>come back
                to a rule engine</strong>, with the pattern mining algorithm <strong>FP-growth</strong>. We get the associations of categorical features that 
                happen the most with fraud. We can then send these rules to the fraud experts who can validate them before going in production.
                With a clean and tested rule registry and regularly updated rulesets, this approach is great.
                This approach is used by Uber in their product <strong><a href="https://www.uber.com/en-FR/blog/project-radar-intelligent-early-fraud-detection/">Uber RADAR</a></strong>.
                
                To be complete on this Rule Engine vs Machine Learning subject, I would like to share <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk9ugHHrZps">Jeremy Jordan's wonderful talk</a></strong> on the subject, one of the best I have seen as he sums up all the aspects of applying ML in Security, showcasing that the Rule Engine should be the basis of these systems.

            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 50px;">Model evaluation and Business KPIs</h3>

                <p>
                    As said in the first part, we aimed at replacing a third party tool, 
                    that is a rule based fraud detection system.
                    The success of our project is reflected in key metrics such as a notable gain in net sales, 
                    the efficiency of our tech stack, and the valuable time saved by fraud experts.
                    Also, we noticed several capital human errors made on the rule based system.
                    Lastly, we replaced the third party tool on 80% of transactions, so a total of 200k euros per day on average.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Remember that when a transaction is blocked, we do not get its label.
                    Indeed, the label of a transaction is always "legit transaction" by default until a fraud is discovered after a cardholder complain, flagging the transaction as fraudulent.
                    <br>Thus, we need a method to get an unbiased sample of data with labels to compute performances of our classifier. 
                    To estimate gains accurately, we implemented a controlled experiment using a Control Group and AB testing methodology. This allowed us to rigorously assess the impact of our fraud detection system and refine our strategies.
                    
                    <br>The concept of Control Group is presented by Stripe in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHSpab1Wi9k&t=1604s">a PyData conference</a>.
